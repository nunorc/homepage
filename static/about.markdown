# About me

Greetings, my name is Nuno Ramos Carvalho and I'm currently a PhD
student in <a href='http://www.uminho.pt'>University of Minho</a> in
the <a href='http://www.map.edu.pt/i'>MAP-i doctoral program</a>.
My thesis is in the area of program comprehension, more specifically trying
to understand how a program works withouth any previous knowledge about
it's implementation or design goals, by relating information gathered by:
source code analysis, the initial problem specification understading, and
real world effects produced by the program.

My main areas of research interests are conception and implementation
of domain specific languages, specification of languages, automatic
construction of compilers and other language-based tools, any general
problems related with languages design and implementation, and
Natural Language Processing.</p>
